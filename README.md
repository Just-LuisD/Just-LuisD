# Hey there! 👋

By day, I'm a coding crafstman building applications for software-defined radios, with a dash of automated test scripting for ASICs. I also tinker with drivers for all sorts of cool test gear like signal generators, network analyzers, and signal analyzers to make test scripting a breeze.

By night, I'm a software adventurer. I love to dive into different realms of software engineering. Here are some of my current quests:

- 🛠️ Mastering Go by building backend magic and nifty CLI tools
- 🌟 Crafting cross-platform UI awesomeness (mostly mobile) with Flutter/Dart
