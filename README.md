# Hey there, welcome! 👋

By day, I’m a software engineer working on applications for software-defined radios and creating automated test scripts for ASICs. I also develop drivers for various test equipment like signal generators, network analyzers, and signal analyzers to simplify test scripting.

In my downtime, I enjoy exploring new areas of software engineering. Here’s what I’m currently diving into:

- 🛠️ Learning Go by building backend solutions and CLI tools
- 📱 Crafting cross-platform UIs (mainly mobile) with Flutter/Dart
